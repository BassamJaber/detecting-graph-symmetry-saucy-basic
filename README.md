# detecting-graph-symmetry-saucy-basic
The goal of this project is to develop a computer program for detecting
symmetries in vertex-colored undirected graphs. The program should mimic
the algorithms in the saucy symmetry detection system. The saucy page at
http://vlsicad.eecs.umich.edu/BK/SAUCY/ should be consulted for papers
that describe how saucy works and give worked-out examples tracing the ex-
ecution of the saucy algorithm.
